            <p>“People regard food as their heaven. Every place in the world, every country has different food cultures and eating habits. Due to differences in location, climate, produce, and topography, a variety of foods have emerged. From these differences in food, myriad cooking techniques have flourished, delighting gourmets everywhere, causing them to linger and return repeatedly.</p>
<p>In the East of Asia, there is a country with a long history and culture, rich in mountain delicacies and captivating flavors. Ingredients and spices from all corners of the world stimulate the nerves and taste buds of billions—this is our great China.</p>
<p>The Chinese food culture primarily emphasizes plant-based foods, with cereals and grains as the staple, supplemented by fruits and vegetables. The reason for this dietary custom stems from the primary economic production mode of agriculture in the Central Plains area, where food distribution also varies among different social classes. Thus, ancient emperors were often called ‘meat eaters.’</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Dietary Customs</strong></p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, hot and cooked foods have been a characteristic of Chinese dietary habits. This is related to the early and advanced development of cooking techniques in China. The ancients said, ‘Fishy for those who live on water, rank for meat-eaters, and gamey for grass-eaters.’ The text ‘Lüshi Chunqiu - Benwei’ records that hot and cooked foods can eliminate fishiness, rankness, and gameyness. Chinese cuisine is world-renowned for its wide variety of recipes and exquisite cooking techniques. Historical records note that during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the chef of Emperor Wu of Liang could create ten different styles from a single melon and dozens of flavors from one dish. The superb cooking skills are astonishing.</p>
<p>Regarding utensils, a major feature of Chinese dietary customs is the use of chopsticks. Chopsticks, called ‘Zhu’ in ancient times, have a long history in China. The ‘Book of Rites’ mentions, ‘One cannot eat millet without chopsticks,’ showing that chopsticks were used as early as the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Generally made of bamboo, a pair of chopsticks is easy and economical to use, and many Westerners marvel at the artistry of their use, which originated mainly from China. The invention of chopsticks by the ancestors of the Chinese was indeed a significant contribution to human civilization.</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Major Chinese Cuisines</strong></p>
<p>Chinese culinary culture has a long history, with the commonly recognized Eight Major Cuisines: Shandong (Lu), Sichuan (Chuan), Guangdong (Yue), and Jiangsu (Su) cuisines, along with Fujian (Min), Zhejiang (Zhe), Hunan (Xiang), and Anhui (Hui) cuisines.</p>
<p>A ‘cuisine’ in China refers to a complete system of cooking skills and flavors that has evolved over a long history due to differences in climate, geography, history, produce, and eating customs in a particular region and is recognized nationwide. There are many schools of thought in cooking. During the Qing dynasty, Chinese cuisine was divided into styles from Beijing, Suzhou, and Guangdong. With considerable cultural development across various regions during the Republic of China period, the styles were classified into North China, Jiangsu-Zhejiang, South China, and Southwest China. Later, the North China style branched into Shandong cuisine, becoming the foremost among the Eight Major Cuisines. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang cuisine was divided into Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui cuisines, and the South China style into Guangdong and Fujian cuisines, while the Southwest style divided into Sichuan and Hunan cuisines. The earlier established Shandong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Guangdong cuisines, and later, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, and Anhui cuisines gradually became famous, forming what is commonly referred to as China’s ‘Eight Major Cuisines.’ After competition, the rankings changed, with Sichuan cuisine rising to second and Jiangsu cuisine moving to third. Eventually, the most influential and representative, and socially recognized cuisines are: Shandong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui, known as the ‘Eight Major Cuisines of China.’”</p>
